					<b>…as told by Ella</b><br />
					We have been aware of each other’s existence for about 2 years
					before we finally met physically in 2016. The meeting was brief and
					fun though short- lived. Fast forward to 2018, we reconnected and
					that was when we actually got talking as we saw each other more.
					After I relocated, our conversations continued, as we always checked
					in on one another, talked about school, work, and life in general.
					Interestingly, the 8-hour time difference worked out well for us, as
					he slept late most days and I worked late, so we spent the time
					conversing....

					<b>…as told by Ella</b><br />
					We have been aware of each other’s existence for about 2 years
					before we finally met physically in 2016. The meeting was brief and
					fun though short- lived. Fast forward to 2018, we reconnected and
					that was when we actually got talking as we saw each other more.
					After I relocated, our conversations continued, as we always checked
					in on one another, talked about school, work, and life in general.
					Interestingly, the 8-hour time difference worked out well for us, as
					he slept late most days and I worked late, so we spent the time
					conversing. In 2020 during the lockdown, the frequency and duration
					of our calls increased even more. I am a chatterbox, so I could go
					on and on, but he would listen to me go and even engage me (side
					note, he doesn't like talking a lot, but we could be on a call for
					hours). Talking to him was just so easy and felt very natural, I
					could be myself with him. Before long, I started to like him a tad
					bit too much for a friend, but it felt like I was catching feelings
					that were not being thrown to me (in Simi’s words) so I buried it
					somewhere. But later that year, we made a marriage pact and agreed
					to get married in 2025 if we were both still single by then. I took
					that as a sign that maybe he liked me too, but because I wasn't sure
					and I did not want to jinx the 2025 plan, I chalked it up to banter
					and we continued as before. Between late 2021 and early 2022, we
					started making jokes about him sending me a virtual engagement ring
					or me paying his “groom’s price”, but we never talked about dating.
					As time passed, these “jokes” became quite common. At this time, we
					already had a deep knowledge of each other’s values, dreams, and
					thoughts on several matters. On a cool night in June 2022 when we
					would start dating, we spoke at length about our future plans,
					careers, and what we both wanted. After almost 6 hours of
					conversation, he asked to be my personal “Yoruba demon” and I
					agreed. The long distance relationship was hard, but we made it
					work. Six months later, he asked me to be his life partner and my
					reply was the quickest yes I have ever said to any important
					question. <br /><br />

					<b>…from Wande’s view</b><br />
					I met her for the first time in 2016 in Ibadan. My first impression
					was, "Who is this skinny human with a sharp mouth?" We spoke for a
					bit, but not in depth. I even loaned her a book, which she
					eventually didn't return. But that was the start of what would grow
					into a beautiful friendship. We reconnected about two years later,
					this time in Lagos. She came to visit a friend and we met up. I even
					gave her directions, lol. Then the frequency of our conversations
					increased. She left the country, but we maintained the friendship.
					After about two years, I knew I liked her, but I wasn't going to do
					long-distance. I played down my feelings for her, but I was sure to
					disturb her whenever I slept late (which was always). It was during
					one of these calls we made a pact that if she is still single when
					she is thirty and peradventure I am unmarried too, then we would get
					married. I had thought to myself then, “what are the odds of this
					happening”? Well it ended up happening earlier than I thought lol. I
					admired her beauty, intellect, and charisma. She's a baby girl with
					a soft heart, even though people don't get to see that part of her.
					Over time, she seemed to take notice of the extra affection I had
					for her. But by this time, I was already gone and could no longer
					hide it, so I made a commitment to give it what it would take to
					make it work. On June 26th, 2022, I asked her to be my girlfriend,
					and she accepted. She had made a "holiday" trip to London to see her
					friends, but I was not just going to patiently wait for the love of
					my life. I hijacked her "holiday" from Heathrow and went on to have
					one of the best moments of the year with her. We connected even more
					in ways we couldn't over the distance. I loved her even more and
					knew immediately I wanted to marry her. I literally started hunting
					for an engagement ring after she left. The next three months without
					her were very long, but we kept up and made the love even stronger.
					My hunt for the perfect ring continued. She was back three months
					later (this time to see me), and I wasted no time in asking her if
					she would like to spend the rest of her life with me. She said
					"yes," and now the rest is history.
